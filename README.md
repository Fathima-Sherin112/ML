## 📌 Project Overview

The Dublin Bikes system is a popular public bike-sharing service in Dublin. Predicting bike availability can help:
- Users plan trips more efficiently
- City authorities optimize bike distribution
- Improve overall system reliability

This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.
